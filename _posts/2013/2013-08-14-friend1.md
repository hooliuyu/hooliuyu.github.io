Can a window be found

Where you an see the dawn

Take a look at the world

Merely dreams bygone

Some rue

Some lose

Some bow

Don't they come to the same foregone

Can a love at all times

No harmsbring along

All the years piles up ,how

Much to say to your heart

All the drunk would be out

All the pain could be sloughed

Once on road

No way to turn around

Fella be cool

I still remain your nest og the soul

Buddy be cool

Believe it right on your route

Human world

Too many things to chase like a fool

The same cruel

I'm feeling for you too
